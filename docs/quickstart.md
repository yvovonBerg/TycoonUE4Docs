# Known issues with Tycoon Beta

⚠️ Source mesh must be facing the Y axis. (When preparing your mesh in your DDC application)

⚠️ Only one material index is supported for track pieces.

⚠️ Material instances in Unreal Engine are not supported currently, but might work on spline meshes.

⚠️ Saving spline presets is not supported yet, however you can still add existing presets to spline based tracks.

⚠️ Having issues converting your track to spline mode? -> You can use the 'Slicing' feature if your mesh is deforming incorrectly.
