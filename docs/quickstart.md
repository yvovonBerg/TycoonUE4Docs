Unreal Marketplace instructions coming soon.


# Known issues with Tycoon Beta

Source mesh must be facing the Y axis. (When preparing your mesh in your DDC application)

Only one material index is supported for track pieces.

Material instances in Unreal Engine are not supported currently.

Saving spline presets is not supported yet, however you can still add existing presets to spline based tracks.

Spline mesh deforms incorrectly in some 90+ degree turns -> You can use the 'Slicing' feature if your mesh is deforming incorrectly.
