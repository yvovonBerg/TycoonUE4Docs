# Building tracks

1. CLick the "New track" button.
This will spawn a new Tycoon collection piece in the world. All your track pieces will be parented under this actor.

2. Select the mesh you want to deform. (See [Preparing custom meshes](prep_mesh.md) for a step by step guide.)
> Tycoon will display a warning for high poly meshes with more than 20k vertices, to adjust this amount click on the collection / main actor and search for warning in the details panel.

3. Adjust the sliders. 
Note: Direction has no effect when the Bend value is 0.0.
You can use the preset buttons to quickly go to 90 degrees.

4. To add a new piece to the track press the "Add" button, the "|" / straight button adds a straight piece without bend / direction or twist values.
