# Package instructions

> You can use the TycoonAnimation module in your shipping builds, because it's an Unreal runtime plugin.


# To package your track

In order to use the data generated from TycoonTool in your shipping build, you will have to convert these actors to non Tycoon objects:

1. Click the package track button.

2. You have an option to delete the existing Tycoon track to cleanup your shipping map.

3. Click 'Yes', you will now see a new actor in your map called 'TycoonConvertedActor'.


# Performance

To optimze the track further you can use the package track feature as well to greatly reduce drawcalls.
